11. List the salesid and last name of each salesperson who represents at least one member.

SELECT DISTINCT  M.LastName, M.FirstName, S.LastName FROM Members M JOIN SalesPeople SP USING(SalesID) JOIN SalesPeople S USING(SalesID);

12. List the salesid and last name of each salesperson who represents at least one member whose birthday is in January.

SELECT DISTINCT  M.LastName, M.FirstName, M.Birthday, S.LastName FROM Members M JOIN SalesPeople SP USING(SalesID) JOIN SalesPeople S USING(SalesID) WHERE M.Birthday LIKE '%-01-%';

13. List the names of the studios with the tracks which were recorded at each one.  Sort the output in order of studioID.

SELECT S.StudioID, S.StudioName, T.TitleID, T.Title FROM Studios S JOIN Titles T USING(StudioID) ORDER BY S.StudioID;

14. List the names of all studios where non-alternative titles have been recorded.

SELECT S.StudioName, T.Title, T.Genre FROM Studios S JOIN Titles T USING(StudioID) WHERE T.Genre NOT LIKE 'alternative';

15a. (6 points) List the titles of all tracks on which (anyone named) Bryce Sanders plays
 
SELECT T.Title FROM Titles T JOIN Artists A USING(ArtistID) JOIN XrefArtistsMembers X USING(ArtistID) JOIN Members M USING(MemberID) WHERE M.FirstName LIKE 'Bryce' AND M.LastName LIKE 'Sanders';

15b) (4 points) How could you revise the query from the last question so that it would distinguish tracks featuring different people who all happen to 
be named Bryce Sanders?  You will *not* be able to test this, since there is only one Bryce Sanders in the database.  

SELECT T.Title FROM XrefARtistsMembers X JOIN Members M USING(MemberID) JOIN Titles T USING(ArtistID) WHERE M.FirstName LIKE 'Bryce' AND M.LastName LIKE 'Sanders';	

16. Find the first name and last name of each member along with a calculated daytime phone number. The daytime phone number should be the work number
if one is listed. If the work number is null, use the home phone number.  You will need to use CASE or IF.

SELECT FirstName, LastName,  
CASE WorkPhone
WHEN WorkPhone  THEN  WorkPhone
ELSE HomePhone
END AS 'Day Time Phone'
FROM Members;
