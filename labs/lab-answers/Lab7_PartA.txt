1. It is an error to use an aggregate function in a WHERE clause, but not in a HAVING clause. What is the  difference between WHERE and HAVING that makes this possible?

SOLUTION:
The difference is that WHERE takes place before any aggregate function runs.  HAVING takes place after the aggregate function runs and it looks at conditions after aggregate is running. HAVING looks at conditions that's in a group. 

2. Suppose the table Vehicles contains the following data:
 
ID       Make
 
1         Honda
2         Ford
3         Ford
4		  BMW 	
5		  BMW
6		  BMW	 		
7		  Honda
8		  Mazda 
What output will the following query produce?
SELECT make, count(*) FROM vehicles GROUP BY make HAVING count(*) > 1;
In this case, list, rather than describe, the actual output row by row.

SOLUTION:  
+--------------------+----------+
| make               | count(*) |
+--------------------+----------+
| Honda              |        2 |
| Ford               |        2 |
| BMW                |        2 |
+--------------------+----------+


3. Consider the following query, which counts the number of artists who do not have web addresses listed in the database:
SELECT COUNT(A.ArtistID) FROM Artists A WHERE A.Webaddress IS NULL;
 
The lecture notes say that count() does not count nulls.  Why does the query still return a good result?

SOLUTION: 
The lecture Notes is correct on the technicality that the WHERE clause filters before aggregation and so it will look at the webaddresses that is NULL and then aggregate COUNT(A.ArtistID) FROM Artists A
