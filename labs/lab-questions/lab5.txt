Section 1: Short Answers, 2 pts each

1. a) (1 pt) What is the numeric index of the first character in a string in SQL?  
An example of a correctly expressed but wrong answer is 5.
1. b) (2 pt) What is the numeric index of the n in the SQL string "John Hurley"?

2. Suppose we want to use a SQL function without referring to any data from an database.  For example, we may want to use greatest() find the largest number in a 
list.  Before the name of the function, we will need to use the _____________ keyword.  (Example wrong answer: WHERE.) 

3. What are nested functions?

4. What arguments do you need for the SQL function concat_ws()?

5. Why is it a bad idea to store age in years as a database field?  What should we do instead?

6. Why do aggregate functions cause errors when used directly in WHERE clauses?

7. Suppose MySQL had a function REVERSECASE(), which took a string (eg, the lastname field from Members) parameter
and returned a new string which all letters which were in lower case in the original string were rendered in upper case
and vice versa.  Would this be an aggregate function?  How can you tell?

8. Suppose MySQL contained a function COUNTNULL(), which returned the number of null values in a particular field in 
all the records for a table.  Would this be an aggregate function?  How can you tell?


Section 2 SQL To English, 4 pts each
Explain in plain English what each query does.

9. SELECT DAYOFWEEK(DATE_ADD(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 10 DAY));

10. SELECT DISTINCT A.Artistname FROM Titles T JOIN Artists A ON T.ArtistID = A.ArtistID WHERE A.Webaddress IS NULL;

11. SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Titles JOIN Artists A USING(ArtistID) WHERE A.Webaddress IS NULL;



Section 3 English To SQL, 12 points each


12. Show the first and last names of each salesperson in a single column, with the first and last names separated 
by a space.  Give the column the heading "Employee Name."

13. Find the circumference of a circle of radius 5 and show the answer to five places past the decimal point.

14. Find the date on which a person who turns 21 today was born. Write your query so that it will work correctly no 
matter when it is run.

15. Report the time in years since each artist was entered into the database (EntryDate).  Assume each year contains 365.25 days.  Write your query so that it will work at 
any date when the query is run.

16. Show the average age in years of all members.

17. List the sales id of each salesperson and whether or not s/he represents a studio whose contact person is Manuel Austin.
Order the results by sales id and use a column alias in the output.  The output should look like this:

+---------+-------------------------+
| salesid | Manuel?                 |
+---------+-------------------------+
|       1 | doesn't work with Manuel|
|       2 | works with Manuel       |
|       3 | doesn't work with Manuel|
|       4 | doesn't work with Manuel|
+---------+-------------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)


Beware: if your output shows any salesid more than once, or if it omits any salesperson, YOUR QUERY IS NOT CORRECT!  Review question 5 in part A.
