CS 122 Lab 7 
Part A, due at the end of the lab period

Section 1: Short Answers, 4 pts each

1. It is an error to use an aggregate function in a WHERE clause, but not in a HAVING clause. What is the  
difference between WHERE and HAVING that makes this possible?

2. Suppose the table Vehicles contains the following data:
 
ID       Make
 
1         Honda
2         Ford
3         Ford
4		  BMW 	
5		  BMW
6		  BMW	 		
7		  Honda
8		  Mazda 
What output will the following query produce?
SELECT make, count(*) FROM vehicles GROUP BY make HAVING count(*) > 1;
In this case, list, rather than describe, the actual output row by row. 

3. Consider the following query, which counts the number of artists who do not have web addresses listed in the database:
SELECT COUNT(A.ArtistID) FROM Artists A WHERE A.Webaddress IS NULL;
 
The lecture notes say that count() does not count nulls.  Why does the query still return a good result?

4. SELECT Titleid, COUNT(Tracktitle) FROM Tracks GROUP BY Titleid;

5. SELECT S.Salesid, S.Lastname, COUNT(TitleID) FROM Salespeople S JOIN Studios ST ON(S.Salesid = ST.salesid) JOIN Titles T
