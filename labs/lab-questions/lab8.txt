6. What is wrong with this code?  Do not just retype the error message, explain the problem.
SELECT T.Title FROM Titles T WHERE T.ArtistID = (SELECT A.ArtistID FROM Artists A WHERE A.Country = "USA");

Suppose we have two tables, named "monsters" and "cars", with the following data:

Monsters:
+----+--------------+--------+
| id | type         | weight |
+----+--------------+--------+
|  1 | Godzilla     |   5500 |
|  2 | Smog Monster |   1000 |
|  3 | Yeti         |    900 |
|  4 | Yeti         |   1100 |
+----+--------------+--------+

Cars:
+----+--------+----------------+--------+
| id | make   | model          | weight |
+----+--------+----------------+--------+
|  1 | Toyota | Camry          |   3200 |
|  2 | Mazda  | 323            |   2000 |
|  3 | Lincoln| Town Car       |   6200 |
|  4 | Ford   | Crown Victoria |   5800 |
+----+--------+----------------+--------+

7.  What would be the output from the following query?
SELECT make, model FROM Cars WHERE weight > ALL (SELECT weight FROM Monsters);

8.  What would be the output from the following query?
 SELECT make, model FROM Cars WHERE weight < ANY (SELECT weight FROM Monsters);
