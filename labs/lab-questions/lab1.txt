CS122 Winter 2016 Lab 1

BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE, send an email to hurley_j@sbcglobal.net requesting a cs1 account.  It may take me 
a couple of days to respond to all the requests.  You will need the logon for part B of this lab.

Part A, 4 points each
Answer the questions in a plain text file (not a word processor document) and turn in on CSNS by the end of the lab 
period in Week 1.

1. 
a) What is a Database Management System (DBMS)?
b) Name three common Database Management Systems

2. What is the definition of a particular database, defining the tables, relationships, constraints, etc. called?  
You should be able to answer this question in one word.

3. Consider the definition of database given in the first lecture.  What does the word "structured" mean in this context?

4. Consider the definition of database given in the first lecture.  What does the word "persistent" mean in this context?

5. SQL is described as a "nonprocedural" or "declarative" language.  What does that mean?  Don't just copy the text 
from the lecture notes or Wikipedia, explain it in your own words.

6. In which table are the names of the salespeople stored?

7. In which table are the names of the members stored?

8. Are there any fields that are common to both of the tables mentioned in the previous two questions?  
If so, which ones?

9. What does it mean if an artist's ArtistID appears as the ArtistID for a record in the titles table?

10. What does it mean if a salesperson's SalesID appears as the SalesID for a studio in the Studios table?

11. Suppose we want to find out the address of a studio.  Which table(s) do we need to check?

12. Suppose we know the name of a title and want to find out the address of the studio where it was recorded.  Which 
table(s) do we need to check?

13. Why do the 6 records in the titles table only have 5 different ArtistIDs?

14. Suppose we want to find out how many different artists have recorded titles at a particular studio, but
we don't need any other information about the artists.  Which table or tables do we need to check, and which 
fields will we need to examine?

15. In order to find out which individuals are members of the Bullets, we need to check Artists, Members, and 
XrefArtistsMembers.  Why do we need all three?


Part B, 40 points
See CSNS for due date

Instructions for logging on to cs1 and running MySQL can be found in the handouts section of the course web page.

Some of the logon passwords will include special characters like tilde (~) or the question mark.  Also 
note that the pipe (|) is located on most keyboards directly over the enter key.  It is longer than either lower 
case L or capital i. 


1) Install the tables of the Lyric database in MySQL on your cs1 account
2) Run the following SQL query:
SELECT * FROM SalesPeople;

The output should look like this:

mysql> SELECT * FROM SalesPeople;
+---------+-----------+----------+----------+--------+------------+
| SalesID | FirstName | LastName | Initials | Base   | Supervisor |
+---------+-----------+----------+----------+--------+------------+
|       1 | Bob       | Bentley  | bbb      | 100.00 |          4 |
|       2 | Lisa      | Williams | lmw      | 300.00 |          4 |
|       3 | Clint     | Sanchez  | cls      | 100.00 |          1 |
|       4 | Scott     | Bull     | sjb      |   NULL |       NULL |
+---------+-----------+----------+----------+--------+------------+
4 rows in set (0.39 sec)

3) Take a screenshot of your output and turn it in on CSNS.
