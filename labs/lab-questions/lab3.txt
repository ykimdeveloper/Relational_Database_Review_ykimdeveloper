CS122, Lab 3
Part A, due at the end of the lab period

Section I, Join Types, 1 point each
For each query, state the type of join (eg, cross join or named column join) that is being used.

1. SELECT Artists.ArtistID, Titles.Title FROM Artists JOIN Titles ON(Artists.ArtistID = Titles.ArtistID);
2. SELECT Artists.ArtistID, Titles.Title FROM Artists, Titles WHERE Artists.ArtistID = Titles.ArtistID;
3. SELECT * FROM Titles JOIN Studios;
4. SELECT M.LastName, M.FirstName, A.ArtistName FROM Members M JOIN XRefArtistsMembers X USING(MemberID) JOIN Artists A USING(ArtistID);

Section II, SQL To English, 4 pts each

Express in one or two sentences what each SQL query does.  For example, a correctly formatted answer would be "This query lists the last name of 
each member with his or her postal code."

Note: If you copy a query which happens to contain a line break in the assignment file and paste it to the MySQL command line, MySQL may be
confused by the apparent end of the query at the line break.  If this happens, you will receive an uninformative error message.  If necessary, 
copy the query into another text editor window, delete the line break, and copy the query from there.

5. SELECT * FROM Members JOIN Salespeople;

6. SELECT R.TrackTitle, T.Title FROM Tracks R JOIN Titles T USING(TitleID) JOIN Studios S USING(StudioID) WHERE Studioname = 'MakeTrax';

7. SELECT ST.StudioName, SA.Initials FROM Studios ST INNER JOIN SalesPeople SA WHERE ST.SalesID = SA.SalesID;

8. SELECT G.Genre, T.Title FROM Genre G JOIN Titles T ON(G.Genre = T.Genre) ORDER BY G.Genre;


Section III, One-Paragraph Answer, 10 Points

Answer in one well-structured paragraph.  A good paragraph contains a general thesis, at least three sentences making points that support 
the thesis, and a concluding sentence.  You should consult the lecture notes and the textbook, and you may also consult Wikipedia, 
MySQL's website, or other sources.  However, DO NOT COPY ANY TEXT.

9. What does it mean to say that SQL is an "open standard with some variations in implementation?" 

Section IV, English To SQL, 10 points 

10. List the first and last names of all members of Sonata in alphabetical order by last name.


Part B, see CSNS for due date
English To SQL, 10 points each

11. List the salesid and last name of each salesperson who represents at least one member.

12. List the salesid and last name of each salesperson who represents at least one member whose birthday is in January.

13. List the names of the studios with the tracks which were recorded at each one.  Sort the output in order of 
studioID.

14. List the names of all studios where non-alternative titles have been recorded.

15a. (6 points) List the titles of all tracks on which (anyone named) Bryce Sanders plays
15b) (4 points) How could you revise the query from the last question so that it would distinguish tracks featuring different people who all happen to 
be named Bryce Sanders?  You will *not* be able to test this, since there is only one Bryce Sanders in the database.  

16. Find the first name and last name of each member along with a calculated daytime phone number. The daytime phone number should be the work number
if one is listed. If the work number is null, use the home phone number.  You will need to use CASE or IF.
