## Database Experience

> Rather, optional topic covered by be from my experience of working with database.

When working with database, there are a couple thing you have to know.
This database is the single truth (usually) for your business. And usually business wants more data like when did users login, when did users do transactions the most often.
To do so, you usually need to log such data but may not be within the same database table.
You may have a audit data table.

## Prepared Statements

Prepared statements is used to create queries that contains placeholder that can
be replaced with variables `?`.

In example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Artists
WHERE ArtistID = ?;
```

Where `?` can be used to replace as any value you plug in later as following
example:

```mysql
# Start by creating preapred statement
PREPARE stmt FROM 'SELECT *
                   FROM Artists
                   WHERE ArtistID = ?';

# In MySQL you can use following syntax to create variable
SET @aid = '1';

# Execute statement with variable
EXECUTE stmt USING @aid;

DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
```

## Store Procedures

Store Procedures allows SQL developers to define function like "procedure" that
can contains some application specific logics inside to allow code reusability
and utilize the database server to do more.

### Defining procedure

In specific, following example creates a GetAllArtists procedure.

```mysql
# We start by defining the delimiter so that the SQL command doesn't end with ";"
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetAllArtists()
  BEGIN
  SELECT * FROM Artists;
  END //
DELIMITER ;
```

### Debugging procedure

After we have defined the store procedure, we can then use the following command
to find out all procedures in the database.

```mysql
SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE db = 'lyric';
```

And if you want to find out the detail of store procedure, you can do following:

```mysql
SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE GetAllArtists;
```

### Variables

Of course that the store procedure doesn't only allow SQL developers to define
a reusable SQL query. In additional to defining the procedure that runs an 
arbitrary query, it also gives the ability to define variables like:

```mysql
# Syntax to create new variable
DECLARE variable_name datatype(size) DEFAULT default_value;

# Example of createing varialbe and plug SQL result in
DECLARE total_products INT DEFAULT 0;

SELECT COUNT(*) INTO total_products
FROM products
```

### Procedure parameter modes

In parameter, we have three modes (`IN`, `OUT` and `INOUT`). We will see how to use
mode in few examples below.

#### IN

To use the variable as `IN` mode example as above, you can follow this example:

```mysql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetArtistsByCity(IN cityName VARCHAR(25))
 BEGIN
 SELECT *
 FROM Artists
 WHERE city = cityName;
 END //
DELIMITER ;
```

Then you can call procedure above like:

```mysql
CALL GetArtistsByCity('London');
CALL GetArtistsByCity('Alverez');
```

#### OUT

Out is used when we want to get specific result out from Query not just getting table

```mysql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE CountArtistsByCity(
 IN cityName VARCHAR(25),
 OUT total INT)
BEGIN
 SELECT count(*)
 INTO total
 FROM Artists
 WHERE city = cityName;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```

Then you can get result by calling procedure and select from result value:

```mysql
CALL CountArtistsByCity('London', @total);
SELECT @total;
```

#### INOUT

`INOUT` mode allows SQL to define mutable variables so that variables can be given
to procedure and mutated in the procedure and get updated values outside of it.

```mysql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE set_counter(INOUT count INT(4),IN inc INT(4))
BEGIN
 SET count = count + inc;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```

```mysql
SET @counter = 1;
CALL set_counter(@counter,1); -- 2
CALL set_counter(@counter,1); -- 3
CALL set_counter(@counter,5); -- 8
SELECT @counter; -- 8
```

## Triggers

To create such table and maintain data you can use **Trigger**.

To create a trigger you can follow the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER `event_name` {BEFORE|AFTER} {INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE}
ON `table_name`
FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
    -- trigger body
    -- this code is applied to every
    -- insert, update, delete row (according to above)
END;
```

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Audit(
    ArtistID int NOT NULL,
    ChangeTimeStamp DateTime DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER `artist_audit` AFTER INSERT
ON `Artists`
FOR EACH ROW INSERT INTO audit (ArtistId) VALUES (NEW.ArtistID);
```

**To drop trigger**

```sql
DROP TRIGGER `artist_audit`;
```

If the trigger body becomes complicated and you need more line, you will need to set up delimiter and change it back accordingly

```sql
delimiter //
CREATE TRIGGER `artist_audit` AFTER INSERT
ON `Artists`
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audit (ArtistId) VALUES (NEW.ArtistID);
END;//
delimiter ;
```

## Data Modeling

In MySQL, I'd summarize the data modeling down to a few concept.

1. Normalization
2. One to many vs one to one vs many to many
3. Think ahead on queries

### [Normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization)

> It's a process of organizing columns and tables to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.

In other word, you want to store as little duplicated data as possible. This concept is the starting of relations!

To do data normalization, you will need to start defining data entities.

Lets take an example project called gradebook -- a student grade sheet project.

This project will probably have a couple entities like students, teachers, grades and classes.

Within each entities, we have to define their attributes.

```
Student {
    id,
    name,
}

Teacher {
    id,
    name,
}

Class {
    id,
    name,
}

Grade {
    classId,
    teacherId,
    studentId,
    name,
    grade,
}
```

Start with basic and add more attributes/entities based on requirement!

### One to many vs one to one vs many to many

When one to one relationship is formed between entities. You will probably want to store the relationship in same table.

For example, when teacher has id and name (think of id and name having one to one relationship). They are usually stored under the same table.

When one to many relationship, it is usually stored in additional table like class to grade.

And when many to many relationship happens, they are also usually stored under a different table!

### Think ahead!

From here, you want to think about the database queries (e.g. what queries you most likely will call).

Lets say in gradesheet project, we will be calling this grade table a lot to get student grade because this student grade is showing up on the homepage of the student.

Then you might want to consider to `Index` this table first to ensure the read performance. Second of all is how can you optimize the data?

## JSON data

Before we move onto the MongoDB (NoSQL) database, I want to talk about the data format -- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

JSON is simple format of representing data. In example:

```json
{
    "name": "Eric",
    "gpa": 3.9,
    "students": [
        "Alice",
        "Bob",
        "Eve"
    ],
    "skills": {
        "mysql": "good",
        "nosql": "good",
        "javascript": "very good"
    }
}
```

So far, we have been learning how to represent data in more like a tabular format (like sql tables).

In upcoming lessons, we will not be using tabular format anymore. Instead we will be using JSON to represent data.

JSON contain a few concepts:

* `{}` indicates an **object** like *skills* or the entire object
    * In object, you have *key* and *value* like `"key": "value"`
    * Each value can be one of the following type:
        * boolean like `true` or `false`
        * strings like `"string"`
        * numbers like `123`, or even `12.33`
        * nested object `{"name": "value"}`
        * array in object like below
        * *null* â€“ empty object
* `[]` indicates a **list** like *students*
* can nest as many levels you want and as many attributes as you want

JSON has been the most popular format of passing data from the front-end to back-end!
And because of this, NoSQL database like MongoDB arise!

More reference to JSON: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-json

NoSQL database store the data in mostly JSON format (as we will see in later lecture).

MySQL recently also add the support to store JSON data (see https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/json.html)

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id int,
    data JSON
);

INSERT INTO students VALUES (1, '{
    "name": "Eric",
    "gpa": 3.9,
    "students": [
        "Alice",
        "Bob",
        "Eve"
    ],
    "skills": {
        "mysql": "good",
        "nosql": "good",
        "javascript": "very good"
    }
}');

SELECT `data` -> "$.name" AS Name
FROM students
WHERE id = 1;

SELECT `data` -> "$.students" AS Name
FROM students
WHERE id = 1;

SELECT `data` -> "$.skills.mysql" AS Name
FROM students
WHERE id = 1;
```
