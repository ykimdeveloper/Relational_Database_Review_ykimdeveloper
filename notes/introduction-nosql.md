# Introduction to NoSQL Database

NoSQL database by definition is "next generation" type of database mostly
addressing some points: non-relational, distributed, open source and horizontal
scalable.

There are a couple NoSQL databases (where you can find the list here http://nosql-database.org/).
But we will be focusing on the MongoDB specifically based on its popularity in 
past few years.

## Why NoSQL?

Small to medium size company, like the company I work with, often uses MongoDB
as the starting point of the micro service. Why?

When building modern web application now, it's often that business requirement
changes in between development cycle and even change in a day or two.

MongoDB databases is designed to help with rapidly changing data types.

Please keep in mind that MongoDB is only within a type of NoSQL database, specifically
under document model database. For the class purose, we will not address other
type of databases.

> Don't just assume NoSQL = MongoDB. That is wrong.

Document model database like MongoDB stores the data in **documents**. And these
documents are typically use a structure like **JSON**. This format is very close
to how modern webapp develops.

In example, to store some data that will only be used by the front-end, you can
now simply store whatever data client side passes without any sort of schema definition
from the backend.

> Note that this type of storage without validation is considered to be ... dangerous.

Furthermore, in document storage, the notion of schema is very flexible: each
document can contain different fields. This flexibility is helpful for modeling
unstructured data. And it also makes the development easier to evolve application
in the development cycle, such as adding new fields.

In short, document model database are for general purpose and useful for wide
variety of applications due to the flexibility of the data modeling -- which we
will see in the following lectures.

## Install MongoDB

https://github.com/csula/Utilities/blob/master/setups/mongo.md

## Import sample data

Download file from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/docs-assets/primer-dataset/primer-dataset.json

> If you are using school laboratory, type in `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/docs-assets/primer-dataset/primer-dataset.json`

And then run below command:

```sh
mongoimport --db test --collection restaurants --drop --file ~/downloads/primer-dataset.json
```

```sh
"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\mongoimport.exe" --db test --collection restaurants --drop --file C:\Users\IEUser\Downloads\primer-dataset.json
```

## Mongo shell commands

Once you finish the installation of MongoDB as above steps, you should also have
Mongo shell installed along with the MongoDB server.

You can start the shell by `mongo`.

> For windows user, look for `mongo.exe` under your MongoDB folder

## CRUD with Mongo shell

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. Often used to describe some
most basic functionality of an app.

In the following sections, we will be discussing the CRUD operations with Mongo
shell.

Before you start any of the CRUD command, you will need change your database (just
like mysql you have to `use` database).

```sh
use test;
```

### Common debugging commands

```sh
# to see all databases
# equals to `show databases;` in MySQL
show dbs; 

# to see all collections
# equals to `show tables;` in MySQL
show collections;
```

### To create and insert a document, you can follow below command.

```javascript
db.restaurants.insert(
   {
      "address" : {
         "street" : "2 Avenue",
         "zipcode" : "10075",
         "building" : "1480",
         "coord" : [ -73.9557413, 40.7720266 ]
      },
      "borough" : "Manhattan",
      "cuisine" : "Italian",
      "grades" : [
         {
            "date" : ISODate("2014-10-01T00:00:00Z"),
            "grade" : "A",
            "score" : 11
         },
         {
            "date" : ISODate("2014-01-16T00:00:00Z"),
            "grade" : "B",
            "score" : 17
         }
      ],
      "name" : "Vella",
      "restaurant_id" : "41704620"
   }
);
```

### To read or find a document, you can follow the below command.

```javascript
// to find all documents under `restaurants`
db.restaurants.find()

// to find a specific restaurants with a column
db.restaurants.find( { "borough": "Manhattan" } )

// or you can even find a field in an embed document 
db.restaurants.find( { "address.zipcode": "10075" } )

// query against a field of an array
db.restaurants.find( { "grades.grade": "B" } )

// if you want to use grater sign
db.restaurants.find( { "grades.score": { $gt: 30 } } )

// or less sign
db.restaurants.find( { "grades.score": { $lt: 10 } } )

// what about logical operation like and and or?
// AND
db.restaurants.find( { "cuisine": "Italian", "address.zipcode": "10075" } )

// OR
db.restaurants.find(
   { $or: [ { "cuisine": "Italian" }, { "address.zipcode": "10075" } ] }
)

// sorting
db.restaurants.find().sort( { "borough": 1, "address.zipcode": 1 } )

// when you call find command you actually do not retrieve any object back
// to retrieve objects back you will need to call `toArray()`
db.restaurants.find().toArray()

// projection
// projection allows you to select certain attributes when retrieve JSON
db.restaurants.find({}, {borough: 1});
```

### To update a document

```javascript
// update takes a query object first and then the fields to update
db.restaurants.update(
    { "name" : "Juni" },
    {
      $set: { "cuisine": "American (New)" },
      $currentDate: { "lastModified": true }
    }
)

// can also update embed document
db.restaurants.update(
  { "restaurant_id" : "41156888" },
  { $set: { "address.street": "East 31st Street" } }
)

// update multiple documents at once
db.restaurants.update(
  { "address.zipcode": "10016", cuisine: "Other" },
  {
    $set: { cuisine: "Category To Be Determined" },
    $currentDate: { "lastModified": true }
  },
  { multi: true}
)

// remember if you don't specify $set then it will replace the whole document
db.restaurants.update(
   { "restaurant_id" : "41704620" },
   {
     "name" : "Vella 2",
     "address" : {
              "coord" : [ -73.9557413, 40.7720266 ],
              "building" : "1480",
              "street" : "2 Avenue",
              "zipcode" : "10075"
     }
   }
)
```

### Delete documents

```javascript
// remove all documents meeting this condition
db.restaurants.remove( { "borough": "Manhattan" } )

// to be on the safe side you can use `justOne` to remove a document at once
db.restaurants.remove( { "borough": "Queens" }, { justOne: true } )

// if you want to remove the entire documents
db.restaurants.remove( { } )

// or you can drop the whole document
db.restaurants.drop()
```
